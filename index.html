	1. Imagine a pile of books, with books stacked one over the other. From this pile of books, you can either put another book on top or remove a book from the top.<br>
	2. The book which is at the bottom of the pile is the last one to be taken out, while the books at the top are removed first. Books can only be added to the top of the pile.<br>
	3. Let the action of putting a book on the top be called as push and let the action of removing a book be called pop. A type of structure, similar to the example of the pile of books, can be represented as a data structure. Such a data structure is known as a stack.<br>

        <p>A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).</p>
